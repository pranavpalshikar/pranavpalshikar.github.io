![Sky with a rainbow and a bird.](rainbow.jpg)

One day,  I went to my terrace. It was a rainy day, and we were having light showers of rain in our city. I looked up in the sky, and I saw a beautiful rainbow. I took my phone out to capture this amazing scene, and out of nowhere, a bird was passing by. Luckily, the bird also got clicked in frame with the rainbow. It turned out to be a beautiful evening for me. Nature never fails to amuse us.
