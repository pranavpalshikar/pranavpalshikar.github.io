It was my birthday and I invited few friends of mine to my house. My best friend is an extreme introvert. When I was having conversations with my other friends, I noticed that he was not talking to anyone. We met after a while so we had nothing too serious to talk about, we were having just a casual conversation.
* My best friend was constantly busy on his phone and was trying to avoid conversations with my other friends. (he hates talking to people) 
* He was talking only to me that day. If anyone would approach him except me, he would either try to avoid them or he would just answer the particular question that was being asked to him. 
* After every conversation, he used to roll his eyes and look up at the ceiling, as if he just had a very boring interaction. 
* While talking to me he did not look at me directly. 
* His face has almost no expression when he is talking. It feels like I am talking to a statue when I interact with him.
* One thing that I noticed was that he moves his neck a lot while he speaks.
